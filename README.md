# DitchThatMouse (DTM)

DTM is a mod that lets you navigate GUIs/menus with your keyboard. Very handy for those in a development environment that don't want to take their hands off the keyboard to create new worlds.


### Usage

* <kbd>TAB</kbd> Next button
* <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>TAB</kbd> Previous button
* <kbd>RETURN</kbd> Click button
* <kbd>SPACE</kbd> Click button
* <kbd>+</kbd> Increment value for slider buttons by 1
* <kbd>-</kbd> Decrement value for slider buttons by 1
* <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>+</kbd> Increment value for slider buttons by 10
* <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> Decrement value for slider buttons by 10

### Good to know
* Buttons are sorted from top left to right by getting their x/y positions on the screen. Sorting logic can be found here [KeyEventHandler#SORT_LEFT_RIGHT](https://github.com/kimfy/DitchThatMouse/blob/master/src/main/java/net/kimfy/ditchthatmouse/client/ui/GuiUtil.java#L16).
